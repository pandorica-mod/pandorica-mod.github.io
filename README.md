### Features
- **Blocks**
    - *Eruption Block*
        - Crafted with 2 *Crusted Magma* and 2 *Netherrack* in a chequerboard pattern
        - Works like the *Magmator*, but the area changes depending on the height
            - 3-4 blocks height-1
            - 5-7 blocks height-2x2
            - 8-9 blocks height-3x3
            - 10-12 blocks height-5x5
            - 13-15 blocks height-8x8
            - 16-20 blocks height-10x10 (max)
    - *Nether Gold Ore*
- **Entities**
    - *Liquefied Skeleton*
        - A *skeleton* variant that spawns in lava oceans
        - Can only survive while in lava
        - *Liquefied Skeletons* will try to pull players into their lava pool
        - Drops 0-3 *Nether Wart*, *Liquefied Bone* and rarely *Crusted Magma*
    - *Magmator*
        - Spawns rarely
            - Hostile
        - Attacks:
            - Charge, kick, pound
            - Pound special attack: a high jump where, within a 10x10 area, Stone becomes *Netherrack*, *Netherrack* becomes a Magma Block, and Magma Blocks become lava
        - Drops 0-2 *Crusted Magma*
        - Models

    - *Fire Spirit*
        - Spawns in groups of 1-3
        - Spawns from *Magma Blocks* occasionally?
        - Charges at the player (through the ground invisibly too!)
        - Sets the player on fire
        - In *Soul Valley*, they will be blue - like fire - but, instead of of burning the player, they deal 4HP damage and effect the player with '*Soul Drain*' for 5 seconds!

        - The player could catch a *Fire Spirit* in a bottle ('*Captured Fire Spirit*') and perhaps be able to convert it into splash potion, which can be thrown at enemies to set them and the ground on fire
        - Takes damage in water
    - *Baby Ghast*
        - Spawns rarely like *Ghasts*
        - Peaceful to the extent that they fly away from the player and don't shoot
        - If there is a normal *Ghast* nearby, it will hide in its tentacle thingies
        - If player attacks a *Baby Ghast*, it will start shrieking for help. This will spawn a normal *Ghast* nearby. The spawning mechanism for this would be similar to `generic.spawnReinforcements`
        - *Baby Ghasts* can be tamed! Taming one is similar to that of a *Cat*
        - *Players* with tamed *Baby Ghasts* can float along with their pet using their tentacles
        - Wild *Baby Ghasts* will grow into adults, whereas tamed ones will not
        - Drops `entities/ghast`
        - Models

    - *Nethermancer*
        - Spawns rarely near *Wither Skeletons*
        - Supports hostile mobs nearby
        - The *Nethermancer* will shoot smoke particle entities at the player - similar to *Shulker Bullets*. These will inflict the *Wither* effect and *Blindness*.
        - Drops `entities/wither_skeleton` and *Wither Staff* (tbd, renamer)
